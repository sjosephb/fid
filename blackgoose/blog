<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2017</p>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide.</i> In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks,</i> Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
